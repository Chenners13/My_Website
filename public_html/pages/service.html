        <h4>After not receiving a single offer for an internship freshman year, I was a bit nervous heading into my sophomore year. Throughout the course of sophomore year first semester, I had slowly accumulated more an 
          more rejections year passed. I didn't have much hope for my interview at Capital One that was scheduled near the end of the year even though I had applied all the way back in August. Much to my surprise, however,
           I received the offer, and I'm happy to say that this summer, I will be interning at Capital One as a part of their Technology Internship Program (TIP) in Plano, Texas</h4>

        <h4> During my freshmen year, I had tried out out for the hockey team and the team was looking forward to have me. Unfortunately, I came
          to the decision to not join the team before the season started in order to focus more on myself and my studies, especially for ETAM. As a result, I imagine that the
          members of the team did not view me in the best way, and therefore this volunteering oppurtunity was the first team bonding event that I had been apart of.
          Our team spent the majority of the morning and afternoon sawing, sanding, and transporting the materials used to created children-sized beds that would obviously 
          allow children to sleep. It felt good not only bonding with my teammates for the first time, but also serving a good cause.

        <h4>For as long as I could remember, I attended a camp a chinese camp called CYC. To my young self, this camp was the week of the year that I looked
          forward to the most, and I my counselors had a lot to do with the experience I had. I knew that when I was old enough, I wanted to 
          give back and do the same thing. For 3 years, I was an assistant counselor at CYC where, for six days, I was tasked with taking care of a group of 20-30 campers.
          I, in addition to 4 other counselors, were responsible for keeping the kids organized throughout all our events, but more importanly, ensuring that camp was a fun experience for them.
