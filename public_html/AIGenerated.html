    <h3> Here's what I asked ChatGPT:</h3>
    <h4> Create an html page that includes Hi my name is Ethan and some more interesting facts about me is that I love anime, working out, and Super Smash Bros. Polo is definitely the best gym on campus, and my favorite anime shows are One Piece, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, and Mob Psycho 100. I am also an avid hockey player and watcher, and play on the TAMU Hockey team. We practice around three times a week and play many of the Texas schools in our conference. My hometown team and my favorite team to cheer for is the Dallas Stars. Add elements like a header and style the page in a modern fashion using CSS. In the header, add a link to 4 pages: a landing page, a qualifications page, a service page, and a technical portfolio page.</h4>
